## Enabling conversational AI interaction with Pega Applications

This package transforms Pega Infinity&trade; interactions into intuitive, conversational experiences through the Model Context Protocol. By bridging Pega DX APIs with natural language interfaces, it enables GenAI Agents, IDEs, and other MCP-enabled tools to interact with Pega Infinity&trade; applications using simple, human-readable commands.

## üß™ Experimental

The Pega DX MCP Server is an experimental project exploring the intersection of Model Context Protocol and Pega Infinity&trade; capabilities. This is not an official Pegasystems product and is not generally available. All commands, parameters, and other features are subject to change or deprecation at any time, with or without notice. Do not use this MCP server for production functionality. This experiment demonstrates the potential of natural language interfaces for Pega Infinity&trade; interactions. We welcome feedback and contributions to help shape the future of GenAI-powered business automation.

## üåü Key Features

- **ü§ñ Natural Language Interface** - Demonstrates conversational case creation: "Create a travel claim for John"
- **üîå Plug-and-Play Integration** - Experimental compatibility with GenAI Agents, IDEs, and MCP-enabled tools
- **üß™ Innovation Prototype** - Exploring enterprise-grade patterns with comprehensive error handling approaches
- **üì° API Integration Exploration** - Investigating access to cases, assignments, attachments, and data operations
- **‚ö° Performance Research** - Experimenting with intelligent caching and optimization strategies
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security Framework** - Implementing OAuth 2.1 with PKCE and role-based access control patterns

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (22+) and npm
- Access to Pega Infinity&trade; (23+) with DX API enabled
- OAuth 2.1 client credentials

### Installation

```bash
# Install from npm (recommended)
npm install -g @pega-enablement/pega-dx-mcp
```

### Integration with MCP Clients

Compatible with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, and other MCP-enabled applications. Add to your MCP client's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pega-dx-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@pega-enablement/pega-dx-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PEGA_BASE_URL": "https://your-pega-instance.com",
        "PEGA_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "PEGA_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration file locations:**
- **Claude Desktop**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows)
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root
- **Cline**: MCP settings in VS Code

**Verify installation:** Restart your MCP client and confirm the Pega DX tools are available.

## üí¨ Usage Examples

> **Note**: The following examples demonstrate envisioned capabilities and planned user experiences. These scenarios represent the experimental goals of this GenAI Innovation project and may not reflect current implementation status.

### Creating a Case

```
User: "Create a new insurance claim for policy #12345"
AI: I'll create a new insurance claim case. What type of claim is this?
User: "Auto accident claim"
AI: ‚úÖ Created auto accident claim case INS-CLAIM-789
    Case ID: INS-CLAIM-789
    Policy: #12345
    Status: Open
    Next step: Provide accident details
```

### Managing Assignments

```
User: "What's my next assignment?"
AI: You have 3 pending assignments:
    1. Review claim documentation (INS-CLAIM-789) - Due today
    2. Approve travel request (TRAVEL-456) - Due tomorrow
    3. Customer callback (SERVICE-123) - Due in 2 hours
User: "Let me work on the claim review"
AI: ‚úÖ Opening claim documentation review for INS-CLAIM-789
    [Displays relevant case data and required actions]
```
